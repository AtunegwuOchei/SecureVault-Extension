im working on a study that attempts to mitigate cyber threats and improve online security practices through the development of a reliable, effective, intuitive, and inexpensive password management tool. The objective is to create a password generator and vault that addresses the following issues:
Autofill functionality
Cross-device synchronization
Expensive pricing models
Functional requirement failures
Limited enterprise-grade features
Technical complexity.
This study aims to empower users by developing a solution that ensures both functionality and a seamless user experience, allowing them to set strong passwords non-repetitively, safely store them, and have them available at every authentication entry point without encountering any of the common issues found amongst today's tools.
Design of the Proposed System
The proposed solution will focus on key areas, such as password generation, password vaulting, multi-factor authentication, usability, and more. It will adopt a hybrid approach to development that combines a browser extension for accessibility with a native application for sensitive security operations. Furthermore, the design thinking framework will be used to drive development, ensuring that the final product accurately meets the needs and preferences of the end user.

System Architecture Overview
The architecture is organized into three principal layers:

Client Layer (User Interface):

Browser Extension: It will integrate reliable autofill functionality into popular browsers, like Chrome, Safari, Edge, Firefox, Samsung Internet, and Opera. It also allows users to generate strong passwords or passphrases using personalized inputs, ensuring that each generated password is unique and strong. And with built-in guides, help users learn the system effortlessly.
Native Application: This will enhance security by handling critical operations such as encryption/decryption and biometric authentication. It will also act as a secure backend for the extension, performing sensitive tasks while ensuring that decryption keys are never exposed in the browser environment.

Application Layer:

Security Engine: This will implement AES-256 encryption and use salted hashing (with bcrypt) to protect stored passwords. It will also enforce a zero-knowledge architecture so that even if the backend is compromised, sensitive decryption keys remain secure.
Authentication Module: The system will use biometric authentication (fingerprint or face recognition) as the sole method for accessing the vault, thereby reducing reliance on a master password. It will also incorporate periodic reauthentication to continuously verify user identity if the app is left unattended for some time.
Synchronization Manager: This will attend to cross-device synchronization issues by ensuring secure and reliable syncing of data across platforms using encrypted channels.

Data Layer:

Password Vault: It will then store encrypted credentials in a PostgreSQL database, employing strong security measures to ensure data integrity.
Local Secure Storage: Encrypted local storage will be used on devices to safeguard temporary data, ensuring that even if local data is accessed, passwords will remain unreadable.

Data Flow Overview:
User Authentication and Registration:
Registration: Users set up a master account, with biometric data captured and stored securely on the device.
Login: The native app authenticates the user using biometrics; upon successful verification, the encrypted vault is retrieved.
Password Generation and Storage:
Generation: Through the browser extension, users are prompted with personalized security questions to generate strong, unique passwords.
Encryption & Storage: The system combines the generated password with a unique salt, applies bcrypt for hashing, encrypts it using AES-256, and stores it securely.
Autofill and Secure Retrieval:
Request: The browser extension securely requests the required password from the native app.
Decryption: The native app decrypts the password and returns it for autofill, ensuring secure local handling of the decryption process.
Primary Use Cases:
Account Creation: New users register via the browser extension, establishing a secure vault and biometric profile.
Password Retrieval: Authenticated users retrieve passwords seamlessly through the extension with mediation by the native app.
Cross-Device Sync: Changes to the password vault are securely synchronized across all devices.
Biometric-Only Authentication: Users gain vault access exclusively through biometric verification, enhancing both security and usability.

3.2.3 Core Features of the Proposed System
The core features are designed to ensure complete functionality, top-tier security, and ease of use. They include:
Password Generation: It will generate strong, unique passwords or passphrases using personalized security questions to reduce predictability.
Password Vault: It will implement salted hashing with bcrypt and AES-256 encryption to ensure that even if the database is compromised, passwords remain secure.
Biometric Authentication: It will rely exclusively on biometric authentication (fingerprint or face recognition) to control access to the vault, minimizing technical complexity.
Secure Communication: It will use native messaging to enable secure, encrypted communication between the browser extension and the native application.
Storage Component: It will securely store passwords and other sensitive details (e.g., credit card information, SSN, BVN) using salted hashing and AES-256 encryption.
Auto-fill Capability: It will autofill credentials within supported browsers.
Secure Password Sharing: It will allow for the secure sharing of credentials among team members or trusted contacts.
Automatic Password Health Audits and Reports: It will regularly assess and report on password strength and health.
Strong Password Policies: It will enforce rules to prohibit poor practices such as password recycling.
Individually Free: It will include robust features for individual use and will be free of charge.
Two-Factor Authentication Integration: It will ensure an additional authentication layer of security by incorporating MFA techniques.
Cross-Platform and Cross-Device Synchronisation: It will provide seamless data syncing across devices and will be available on multiple platforms.
Zero-Knowledge Architecture: It will guarantee that only users can see their data.
Breach Alerts/Notifications: It will notify users promptly in the event of a security breach.
Intuitive Interface Design and Usage Tutorials: It will have an accessible and easy-to-use interface, supported by clear tutorials.
Strong Data Encryption: Shared data will be encrypted in transit and at rest.
Offline Functionality: Maintain core functions even without an active internet connection.
Enterprise and Team Plans: It will provide affordable plans ($2 for teams and $3 for enterprises) to cater to business needs.
Native App and Extension Integration: It will seamlessly integrate the native app with the browser extension for a unified experience.
